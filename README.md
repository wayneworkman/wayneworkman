I’m an AWS solutions architect with a strong background in infrastructure, cloud automation, and Python development. My free-time passions are currently focused on embedded systems, microcontrollers, and electronics — especially around low-power robotics, LoRa communication, and custom PCB design.

I enjoy building things that solve real problems, whether it’s a secure radio protocol, a battery-aware sensor system, or a weird little robot that sends telemetry from the middle of nowhere. I also like working with neural networks, and I’m exploring ways to train and deploy models on small devices like the Google Coral.

You’ll find a mix of hardware experiments, utility scripts, and project documentation here. I value simplicity, clarity, and solutions that work reliably in the real world.
